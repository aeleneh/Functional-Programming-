# Functional-Programming-
Task 1: Build a function-based console log message generator
In this exercise, your task is to code a function named consoleStyler, which accepts four parameters:

color
background
fontSize
txt
Inside the body of the consoleStyler() function declaration, you need to do the following:

Create a new variable named message, and assign the following to it on the very first line inside the consoleStyler() function body.:

"%c" + txt;
Tip: Do not copy the 3 back ticks. These are used to format this document in the Preview tab.

Create a style variable and assign the following to it on the next line:

`color: ${color};`
Tip: The single backtick before color and after the semi-colon must be included.

Next, update the style variable (using the += operator) with the following code:

`background: ${background};`
Tip: The single backtick before background and after the semi-colon must be included.

Then, update the style variable (again, using the += operator) with the following code:

`font-size: ${fontSize};`
Tip: The single backtick before font-size and after the semi-colon must be included.

Finally, console log the message and style variables inside the consoleStyler function declaration.

Hint: Be sure to use backticks (``) when updating your variable styles and not single ('') or double ("") quotes.


Task 2: Build another console log message generator.
Your task is to code another function, and name it celebrateStyler(). The function accepts a single parameter, reason, which should be of string data type.

Inside the function declaration's body, code the following:

A new variable, named fontStyle, assigning it this code:

"color: tomato; font-size: 50px";
On the next line, an if statement, verifying that reason == "birthday".

Inside the body of the if block, code the following:

console.log(`%cHappy birthday`, fontStyle);
On the next line, add an else if, and inside the parentheses, check that

reason == "champions"
Inside the else if block, add this code:

console.log(`%cCongrats on the title!`, fontStyle);
Add an else block, with the following code inside of it:

console.log(message, style);

Task 3: Run both the consoleStyler and the celebrateStyler functions
Invoke the consoleStyler() function, with the following arguments:

'#1d5c63'

'#ede6db'

'40px'

'Congrats!'

Next, invoke the celebrateStyler() function, with the following argument:

'birthday'
Task 4: Insert a congratulatory and custom message
Code another function, named styleAndCelebrate().
The function declaration's body should consist of two function invocations:

consoleStyler(color, background, fontSize, txt);  
celebrateStyler(reason);
Next, invoke the new function, using the following arguments:

'ef7c8e'
'fae8e0'
'30px'
'You made it!'
'champions'
